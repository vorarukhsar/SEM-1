<h1>About</h1>
<h2>History & Establishment</h2>
<P color:blue;>After returning from South Africa, Gandhiji moved all over India. He personally experienced the political, social, educational and economic deteriorated conditions after observing life of Indian people.<br>
 Bapu made untiring efforts to find solution to all there problems. He made some initial experiments of education in Kochrab and Sabarmati Ashram during 1915-1920.

<br>In August 1920, Gadhiji started non co-operation movement.<br>
 Gandhiji asked everybody to boycott the Honours and Awards of British empire; schools and colleges imparting English education, Courts and Legislative Assemblies.<br>
 One of the most important issues of this non co-operation movement was to boycott all schools and colleges under British Government’s control and to liberate the Indian youths from the shackles of British colonial rule. <br>
 As against the British colonial education system, propounded by Lord Macaulay, that produced human resources for the oppressive British Empire.<br>
 There was a great response to Gandhiji’s command to vacate the English teaching schools and colleges.<br>
 Now, in order to see that the students who left their education half-way are not deprived of the education, <br>
 it was decided to estalish National Vidyapith. <br>
 Out of those five Vidyapiths established during that period, Gujarat Vidyapith was one, estalished by Gandhiji himself on October 18, 1920. <br>
 Gandhi wanted his Vidyapith to prepare the youths for the task of national reconstruction and usher in 'Hind Swaraj', the India of his dream.<br>

Gujarat Vidyapith was established as a national university without a government charter. Gandhiji was its life-long chancellor.<br>
 Professor A T Gidwani was its founder vice-chancellor. After Gandhiji, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, Dr.<br>
 Rajendra Prasad and Morarji Desai adorned the post of chancellor of the Vidyapith.<br>
 Later, many more institutions, colleges and schools were affiliated to the Vidyapith.<br>

Upto 1930, the languages like Gujarati, Marathi, Bengali, Sanskrit, Pertian and English and the subjects like History, Arithmatics, Philosophy, Economics.<br>
 Accountancy, Music, Political Science, Pharmacy, Archeology and Indian studies were taught in Gujarat Vidyapith at graduation level.<br>
 The Vidyapith stopped functioning temporarily during the civil disobedience movements of 1930 to 1935, <br>
 both the students and faculty members participated actively in the freedom struggle, many of them courting arrest.<br>
 Again, during 1942 to 1945, during “Quit India” movement the functioning of Vidyapith came to a standstill.<br>
 After the year 1945, the Vidyapith started its activities once again.

In June 1947, Mahadev Desai Samaj Sewa Mahavidyalay (M.D.S.S.M.V.) was established.<br>
 Initially only degree level courses were conducted in this college (M.D.S.S.M.V.). <br>
 Considering the national and international level significance in value based education of Vidyapith.<br>
 The Government of India, in July 1963, under the University Grants Commission (UGC) Act, 1956, <br>
 under its section 3 recognised Gujarat Vidyapith as “deemed to be University” and started providing grants in aid to Gujarat Vidyapith. <br>
 After joining the Universe of Universities, the level of educational courses in Gujarat Vidyapith were upgraded upto M.A., M.Phil; and Ph.D. level.<br>
 Besides, the Rashtrabhasha Hindi Prachar Samiti; Adult Education, Tribal Research and Training Institute <br>
 and Krushi Vignan Kendras were established in Gujarat Vidyapith.
<br>
Today, it is one of the national universities with a charter from the Government of India and seeks to promote <br>
Gandhiji's ideals of service-oriented education.
